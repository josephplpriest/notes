# 5 Common Github Profile Mistakes

## Who is this for:
Data Analysts, Scientists, Engineers, Software Engineers, Web Developers

## 1. Not using README files correctly.

- Never heard of a README file? It's a specially-formatted text file that github will display for you by default. Just add it to the root directory of your public repository. This article is written in markdown. It allows using headers, in-line text formatting, images, links and more!

- Note - you'll need to title it README.md exactly for github to display it by default.

- Github will give you a repo with your username. Put a README there and it will show up on your profile landing page. Include a nice picture (yourself or something you're interested in) and a short about-me section related to your coding background/interests.

- 


- Any public repos should have AT MINIMUM a README saying what they contain. A high-level overview for someone non-technical, information about how a project is organized, and information about how to build/install/run your code will all set your projecs apart positively.


## 2. No capitalization/spaces in filenames.


## 3. 


## 4. Your Github Profile does not match the jobs you are applying to.
- Github will show icons for what languages are used in a repository. Additionally, if you go into a repo, it will show what percentages for each language used. 

Some example mismatches:

Apply for Front-End Web Development - No Javascript/Html/CSS projects
Apply for Data Engineering role and have zero SQL code/projects


## 5. Repository organization
- Github will let you pin repos that you'd like a viewer to see first. Put your biggest and best projects there (they better have good README files, remember?), not the time you did a git commit on your grocery list and forgot about it.
